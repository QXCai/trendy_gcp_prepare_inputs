These scripts are used for preparing input files (most importantly LUH landuse input) for the TRENDY simulations.
Important: Modify all paths in scripts for your application and note some commented-out lines that need to be un-commented for preparing historical LUH files (as opposed to "extension").
You are free to use these scripts - open source! Please fork this repository and share your additions/modifications through github.
